It looks like you're setting up OAuth 2.0 for your application and need to choose an application type for your OAuth client. Here’s a quick guide to help you select the right type based on the nature of your application:

Web Application: Choose this if your app runs on a web server and users interact with it via a web browser. This is ideal for server-side apps where you handle user authentication and authorization.

Desktop App: Select this if your app is a standalone desktop application that runs on a user's computer. This is suitable for apps that need to interact with OAuth on the user’s machine.

Mobile App: Use this option for applications running on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. This is tailored for apps on iOS or Android platforms.

Other: This is used for applications that don't fit into the above categories, such as command-line tools or IoT devices. If your application doesn’t neatly fit into any of the above categories, you might use this option.

If you're working with a code editor or development environment, the application type you choose should match the nature of your codebase and deployment scenario. For instance, if you’re working on a web app, “Web Application” would be the appropriate choice. If it’s a mobile app, then choose “Mobile App.”

Would you like more detailed guidance on any of these options?

If you're using Codespaces and you need to set up OAuth 2.0 to authorize your application, here's a step-by-step guide to help you obtain an authorization code:

Setting Up OAuth 2.0 for Codespaces
Go to the Google Cloud Console:

Visit the Google Cloud Console.
Create a New Project (if you don’t have one):

Click on the project drop-down at the top of the page and select "New Project."
Enter a project name and click "Create."
Set Up OAuth Consent Screen:

Navigate to the APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.
Choose an application type and fill out the required fields (Application name, Authorized domains, etc.).
Save the changes.
Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:

Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
Choose the application type based on your needs:
Web Application: If your Codespace is running a web server.
Desktop App: If it’s a local application.
Mobile App: For mobile applications.
Enter the necessary information:
Authorized Redirect URIs: For web applications, this is where the OAuth 2.0 server will redirect users after authorization. If you're working in a Codespace, you might use http://localhost or a specific port depending on your setup.
Obtain Your Client ID and Client Secret:

After creating the credentials, you’ll get a Client ID and Client Secret. Make sure to save these securely.
Get the Authorization Code:

Construct the authorization URL. Here’s a typical format:

bash
Copy code
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=SCOPE&
  access_type=offline
YOUR_CLIENT_ID: The client ID you obtained from step 5.
YOUR_REDIRECT_URI: The redirect URI you specified when setting up your OAuth client.
SCOPE: The permissions your application needs (e.g., https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email).
Open this URL in your browser. You’ll be prompted to authorize your application.

Once authorized, you'll be redirected to the redirect URI with a code parameter in the URL. This code is your authorization code.

Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token:

Use the authorization code to get an access token. You need to make a POST request to the token endpoint:

bash
Copy code
POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
Parameters:
code: The authorization code you received.
client_id: Your client ID.
client_secret: Your client secret.
redirect_uri: Your redirect URI.
grant_type: authorization_code
This request will return an access token that you can use to make authorized API requests.

Example of Exchanging the Authorization Code
Here’s an example of a cURL request to exchange the authorization code:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to get an authorization code and exchange it for an access token. Let me know if you need more specific help or run into any issues!

It looks like you're trying to use the POST command directly in your terminal, which isn't the correct approach for making HTTP requests. Instead, you should use a tool like curl or http to perform HTTP requests from the command line.

Here’s how to use curl to exchange the authorization code for an access token:

Using curl to Exchange Authorization Code
Ensure curl is installed: Most systems have curl installed by default. If not, you can usually install it via your package manager.

Use the curl command: Construct your curl command with the appropriate parameters. Here’s the format:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
Replace:

YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE with the code you received.
YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your OAuth 2.0 Client Secret.
YOUR_REDIRECT_URI with the redirect URI you used.
Example
Here’s an example with placeholders filled in:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=4/AbcD1234EfGhIJKLmnOpQRstUvWXYz" \
  -d "client_id=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  -d "client_secret=your-client-secret" \
  -d "redirect_uri=http://localhost" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
Using httpie (Optional)
If you prefer a more readable syntax, you might use httpie, which is a command-line HTTP client:

Install httpie (if you don’t have it):

bash
Copy code
pip install httpie
Make the request:

bash
Copy code
http POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE \
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI \
  grant_type=authorization_code
This should give you a JSON response containing the access token and other details. If you encounter any issues, make sure you check the response for any error messages or status codes that might indicate what went wrong.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Based on the OAuth 2.0 configuration you’ve provided, you can use curl or httpie to obtain an access token using the authorization code.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. Obtain the Authorization Code
First, you need to have the authorization code. To get it:

Construct the authorization URL and open it in your browser:

text
Copy code
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com
  &redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
  &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
  &access_type=offline
Log in to your Google account and authorize the application. You will be redirected to the redirect URI with an authorization code in the URL (e.g., https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback?code=AUTH_CODE).

Copy the authorization code from the URL.

2. Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token
Use curl to exchange the authorization code for an access token:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  -d "client_secret=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" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
Replace YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE with the actual code you received.

3. Using httpie
Alternatively, if you prefer httpie, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
http POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE \
  client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com \
  client_secret=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 \
  redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback \
  grant_type=authorization_code
4. Handling the Response
The response from the token endpoint will be a JSON object containing the access token and possibly a refresh token, like this:

json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "ya29.a0ARrdaM...Qk7L",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "1//0gGk8w...8D3Q",
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
access_token: Use this token to make authorized API requests.
refresh_token: Use this token to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
Make sure to store these tokens securely and handle them according to best practices. If you encounter any issues, check the response for error messages and verify all parameters are correct.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The "invalid_grant" error with the description "Malformed auth code" indicates that there was an issue with the authorization code you used. This can happen for a few reasons:

Troubleshooting Steps
Verify Authorization Code:

Ensure that the authorization code you copied is correct and has not expired. Authorization codes are typically short-lived and can expire quickly.
Double-Check Redirect URI:

Make sure the redirect URI used in your OAuth 2.0 client configuration matches exactly with the redirect URI you used in the authorization request. It must be the same URI where you received the authorization code.
Check URL Encoding:

Make sure that the authorization_code, client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri are correctly URL-encoded. Special characters in the values might cause issues if not encoded properly.
Regenerate Authorization Code:

If you suspect the authorization code might have expired or is incorrect, you can regenerate it. Go through the authorization process again to obtain a new authorization code.
Review OAuth Setup:

Ensure that your OAuth 2.0 setup on the Google Cloud Console is correctly configured. Confirm that you have set up the consent screen, scopes, and redirect URIs properly.
Example cURL Command
Here’s a revised example of a curl command to exchange the authorization code, ensuring that you replace placeholders with actual values:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=YOUR_ACTUAL_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  -d "client_secret=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" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
Steps to Obtain a New Authorization Code
Revisit Authorization URL:

Construct the authorization URL with the same parameters and open it in your browser:
text
Copy code
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com
  &redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
  &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
  &access_type=offline
Authorize and Get Code:

After authorizing the app, you'll be redirected to the redirect URI with a new authorization code in the URL. Use this new code in your curl command.
Try Again:

Use the new authorization code with the curl command to obtain the access token.
If you’re still encountering issues, please let me know the exact details of any new error messages, and we can troubleshoot further.

It sounds like you’re seeing the authorization URL in your Codespace's browser or terminal, but it might be better to open this URL in your local web browser for the authorization flow to work properly.

Here’s how you can proceed:

Steps to Complete the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow
Open Authorization URL in Local Browser:

Copy the authorization URL you provided and paste it into your local web browser. Make sure you replace any placeholders with actual values if needed. Here’s the URL with your parameters:

text
Copy code
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
  ?response_type=code
  &client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com
  &redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
  &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
  &access_type=offline
Authorize the Application:

When you open the URL in your local browser, you will be prompted to log in to your Google account and authorize the application.

Get the Authorization Code:

After you authorize the application, you will be redirected to your redirect URI (https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback) with an authorization code included in the query parameters of the URL. It will look something like this:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback?code=AUTH_CODE
Copy the AUTH_CODE from the URL.

Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token:

Use the curl command to exchange the authorization code for an access token. Ensure you replace YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE with the code you obtained:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
  -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  -d "client_secret=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" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
This should give you a JSON response with the access token and other relevant information.

Alternative Approach if You Cannot Access the Redirect URI
If you cannot access the redirect URI in your Codespace, you may:

Use a Local Redirect URI:

Temporarily change the redirect_uri to http://localhost or another local endpoint where you can capture the authorization code. Update this in your Google Cloud Console and in the authorization URL you use.

Update OAuth Client:

In the Google Cloud Console, make sure your OAuth client is set up with a redirect URI that matches what you are using. For a development environment, you might use http://localhost and capture the authorization code manually.

Verifying Your OAuth Setup
Check Redirect URI: Make sure the redirect URI registered in the Google Cloud Console exactly matches the one used in the authorization request and where you expect to capture the code.

Verify OAuth Consent Screen: Ensure the OAuth consent screen is configured correctly and that your application is authorized to request the necessary scopes.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to successfully obtain an authorization code and exchange it for an access token. Let me know if you run into any more issues or if there’s anything else I can assist with!

Great, it looks like you have successfully received the authorization code. Here’s what you need to do next:

Steps to Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token
Extract the Authorization Code: From the URL you provided, extract the authorization code:

Copy code
4/0AQlEd8xX8zwCKjvzh5h0AH21TBOv5IPV6G-BtUbhEovX9la32Avdt9YA9Z4B_IG4jdfHDg
Use curl to Exchange the Authorization Code: Replace YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE in the following curl command with the code you extracted:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
  -d "code=4/0AQlEd8xX8zwCKjvzh5h0AH21TBOv5IPV6G-BtUbhEovX9la32Avdt9YA9Z4B_IG4jdfHDg" \
  -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
  -d "client_secret=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" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
This command should be run in your terminal or command-line interface.

Review the Response: If the request is successful, you will receive a JSON response containing the access token and possibly a refresh token. Here’s an example response:

json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "ya29.a0ARrdaM...Qk7L",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "1//0gGk8w...8D3Q",
  "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
access_token: This is used to make authorized API requests.
refresh_token: Use this to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires.
expires_in: The duration in seconds until the access token expires.
Use the Access Token: With the access token, you can now make authorized requests to Google APIs. For example, to get user info, you can use:

bash
Copy code
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo
Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token you received.

Handling Common Issues
Malformed Request: Ensure all parameters are correctly URL-encoded.
Invalid Grant: Double-check that the authorization code hasn't expired and matches the redirect_uri exactly.
If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please let me know!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
When you're setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials for a YouTube API integration, including for uploading videos, the redirect URI is a crucial part of the authentication flow. If you're using GitHub Codespaces, the redirect URI would need to correspond to the environment in which the Codespace is running.

For GitHub Codespaces, the redirect URI generally has the following format:

php
Copy code
http://<your-codespace-name>.<user>.githubpreview.dev
Here's a more concrete example of what it might look like:

bash
Copy code
http://my-codespace-abc123.githubpreview.dev/oauth2callback
In this example:

my-codespace-abc123 would be replaced with the actual name of your Codespace.
/oauth2callback is a common path used for handling OAuth 2.0 responses, but you should replace this with whatever path you have configured in your app.
To ensure proper setup:

In Google Cloud Console:

Go to the OAuth 2.0 credentials section.
Add the redirect URI under the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs configuration.
In Your Application:

Make sure your application is configured to handle the redirect URI specified and process the OAuth 2.0 response.
Note that GitHub Codespaces may use a different domain or have variations in the URL format. You might need to adjust based on the specific details provided by GitHub or test it out to ensure that the redirect URI correctly matches your Codespace environment.

If your GitHub Codespace URL is https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/, then your redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 authentication with the YouTube API should be structured accordingly.

Here's how you should format the redirect URI:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Steps to Configure Redirect URI:
Google Cloud Console Configuration:

Go to your Google Cloud Console.

Navigate to the APIs & Services > Credentials section.

Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and edit it.

In the Authorized redirect URIs section, add the URI:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Save the changes.

Application Setup:

Ensure that your application is configured to handle requests at the /oauth2callback endpoint.
This endpoint should handle the OAuth 2.0 authorization response, including extracting the authorization code and exchanging it for an access token.
Notes:
The /oauth2callback path is just an example; you should replace it with whatever path your application is using to handle OAuth callbacks if it differs.
Verify the exact path with your application's routing configuration if needed.
If you're deploying your application in a different environment or have additional requirements, adjust the redirect URI accordingly.
By following these steps, your OAuth 2.0 flow should work correctly with the GitHub Codespaces environment.

Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

Update Redirect URI in Google Cloud Console:

Log in to the Google Cloud Console.

Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and click Edit.

In the Authorized redirect URIs section, add:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Save your changes.

Configure Your Application:

Ensure your application has a route to handle requests at /oauth2callback (or your specific callback path).
This route should manage the OAuth 2.0 callback process, including extracting and handling the authorization code.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the OAuth flow to ensure the redirect URI is correctly handling the response.
You might need to adjust the path or the handling logic based on your specific application needs.
If your Codespace URL changes or if you’re working in different environments, make sure to update the redirect URI accordingly in both your application and the Google Cloud Console.

### 3. Testing and Debugging

1. **Authorize Application**:
- Open the following URL in your browser to start the authorization process:

  ```
  https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
    ?response_type=code
    &client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com
    &redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
    &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload
    &access_type=offline
  ```

2. **Extract Authorization Code**:
- After authorizing the application, you will be redirected to `https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback` with an authorization code in the URL. Extract this code.

3. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**:
- Use `curl` or another HTTP client to exchange the authorization code for an access token:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
    -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
    -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
    -d "client_secret=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" \
    -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
    -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
  ```

- Replace `YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE` with the actual code you obtained.

## Notes

- **Redirect URI**: Ensure the redirect URI in your Google Cloud Console matches the one used in your application. If the URL of your Codespace changes, you will need to update this URI accordingly.
- **OAuth Scopes**: Adjust the `scope` parameter in the authorization URL based on the specific permissions your application requires.

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate OAuth 2.0 with the YouTube API for video uploads using GitHub Codespaces.

For more information on OAuth 2.0 setup and configuration, refer to the [Google OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2).
This README.md file includes all the necessary details for configuring OAuth 2.0 in your GitHub Codespace and provides guidance on setting up the redirect URI, obtaining the authorization code, and exchanging it for an access token.

When you're setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials for a YouTube API integration, including for uploading videos, the redirect URI is a crucial part of the authentication flow. If you're using GitHub Codespaces, the redirect URI would need to correspond to the environment in which the Codespace is running.

For GitHub Codespaces, the redirect URI generally has the following format:

php
Copy code
http://<your-codespace-name>.<user>.githubpreview.dev
Here's a more concrete example of what it might look like:

bash
Copy code
http://my-codespace-abc123.githubpreview.dev/oauth2callback
In this example:

my-codespace-abc123 would be replaced with the actual name of your Codespace.
/oauth2callback is a common path used for handling OAuth 2.0 responses, but you should replace this with whatever path you have configured in your app.
To ensure proper setup:

In Google Cloud Console:

Go to the OAuth 2.0 credentials section.
Add the redirect URI under the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs configuration.
In Your Application:

Make sure your application is configured to handle the redirect URI specified and process the OAuth 2.0 response.
Note that GitHub Codespaces may use a different domain or have variations in the URL format. You might need to adjust based on the specific details provided by GitHub or test it out to ensure that the redirect URI correctly matches your Codespace environment.

If your GitHub Codespace URL is https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/, then your redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 authentication with the YouTube API should be structured accordingly.

Here's how you should format the redirect URI:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Steps to Configure Redirect URI:
Google Cloud Console Configuration:

Go to your Google Cloud Console.

Navigate to the APIs & Services > Credentials section.

Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and edit it.

In the Authorized redirect URIs section, add the URI:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Save the changes.

Application Setup:

Ensure that your application is configured to handle requests at the /oauth2callback endpoint.
This endpoint should handle the OAuth 2.0 authorization response, including extracting the authorization code and exchanging it for an access token.
Notes:
The /oauth2callback path is just an example; you should replace it with whatever path your application is using to handle OAuth callbacks if it differs.
Verify the exact path with your application's routing configuration if needed.
If you're deploying your application in a different environment or have additional requirements, adjust the redirect URI accordingly.
By following these steps, your OAuth 2.0 flow should work correctly with the GitHub Codespaces environment.

It looks like you’re working within a GitHub Codespace located at /workspaces/debuging. In this case, the redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 should be adjusted to reflect the URL associated with your Codespace environment.

Given your Codespace URL is https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/, the redirect URI you use in your OAuth 2.0 client configuration will likely need to be:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

Update Redirect URI in Google Cloud Console:

Log in to the Google Cloud Console.

Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.

Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and click Edit.

In the Authorized redirect URIs section, add:

bash
Copy code
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
Save your changes.

Configure Your Application:

Ensure your application has a route to handle requests at /oauth2callback (or your specific callback path).
This route should manage the OAuth 2.0 callback process, including extracting and handling the authorization code.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the OAuth flow to ensure the redirect URI is correctly handling the response.
You might need to adjust the path or the handling logic based on your specific application needs.
If your Codespace URL changes or if you’re working in different environments, make sure to update the redirect URI accordingly in both your application and the Google Cloud Console.
