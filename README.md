# OAuth 2.0 Configuration for YouTube Video Upload

## Overview

This document provides the setup for OAuth 2.0 credentials required for integrating with the YouTube API, specifically for uploading videos. It includes details for using GitHub Codespaces as the development environment.

## Credentials

Here are the OAuth 2.0 credentials used for this setup:

- **Client ID**: `715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Client Secret**: `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`
- **Redirect URI**: `https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback`

## Steps to Configure OAuth 2.0

### 1. Set Up Redirect URI in Google Cloud Console

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
3. Locate your OAuth 2.0 Client ID and click **Edit**.
4. In the **Authorized redirect URIs** section, add:
   
https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback

markdown
Copy code

5. Save your changes.

### 2. Configure Your Application

Ensure your application has a route to handle requests at `/oauth2callback`. This route should manage the OAuth 2.0 callback process, including:

- Extracting the authorization code from the callback URL.
- Exchanging the authorization code for an access token using the Google OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.

### 3. Testing and Debugging

1. **Authorize Application**:
- Open the following URL in your browser to start the authorization process:

  ```
  https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
    ?response_type=code
    &client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com
    &redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback
    &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload
    &access_type=offline
  ```

2. **Extract Authorization Code**:
- After authorizing the application, you will be redirected to `https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback` with an authorization code in the URL. Extract this code.

3. **Exchange Authorization Code for Access Token**:
- Use `curl` or another HTTP client to exchange the authorization code for an access token:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token \
    -d "code=YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE" \
    -d "client_id=715144864465-0si1ip7sqslli3ptg14ktl7mc0f71dqe.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
    -d "client_secret=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" \
    -d "redirect_uri=https://glowing-yodel-55j94rx6qg5c4j77.github.dev/oauth2callback" \
    -d "grant_type=authorization_code"
  ```

- Replace `YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE` with the actual code you obtained.

## Notes

- **Redirect URI**: Ensure the redirect URI in your Google Cloud Console matches the one used in your application. If the URL of your Codespace changes, you will need to update this URI accordingly.
- **OAuth Scopes**: Adjust the `scope` parameter in the authorization URL based on the specific permissions your application requires.
When using Google OAuth in a Codespace (or any environment where localhost might not be accessible), you may encounter issues with the redirect URI. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:

1. Update the Redirect URI
In your Google Cloud Console:

Go to Credentials and find the OAuth 2.0 client ID you're using.
Under Authorized redirect URIs, add the specific URL provided by Codespaces (usually something like https://<your-codespace>.preview.app/...) instead of http://localhost:8080.
2. Use the run_console Method
If you can't change the redirect URI easily, you can modify the code to use the console method for authentication. Change this line in the get_authenticated_service function:

python
Copy code
credentials = flow.run_local_server()
to:

python
Copy code
credentials = flow.run_console()
This will prompt you to manually enter the authorization code after visiting the URL.

3. Environment Configuration
Make sure your environment is set up correctly to handle the OAuth flow. Sometimes, using a different port or ensuring that your Codespace allows inbound connections is necessary.

4. Test the Setup
Once you make the changes, run your script again, and follow the prompts. You should be able to authenticate and upload your video.

creat a vbs file that open the colck dialog and set the time
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a VBS file that opens the clock dialog in Windows and sets a specific time, you'll need to utilize Windows Script Host (WSH) capabilities. However, please note that directly setting the system time programmatically may require administrative privileges and could be restricted by user permissions or security policies.

Here's a simple VBS script that demonstrates how to open the Date and Time settings dialog, but setting the time directly isn't straightforward without user interaction:

vbscript
Copy code
' Create a new WScript Shell object
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

' Open the Date and Time settings dialog
WshShell.Run "timedate.cpl"

' Optionally, you can show a message box to inform the user
MsgBox "Please set the time in the Date and Time settings dialog.", vbInformation, "Set Time"
Instructions to Create and Run the VBS File
Open Notepad (or any text editor).
Copy and paste the script above into the text editor.
Save the file with a .vbs extension, for example, OpenClockDialog.vbs.
Double-click the .vbs file to run it.
Important Notes
Permissions: Changing system time directly via script may require elevated privileges.
User Interaction: The user will need to set the time manually in the dialog that opens.
Usage: This script is safe and can be used to guide users to change the time rather than doing it automatically.
If you need more advanced functionality, including setting the time directly, it might require PowerShell or a more complex script, but always consider security implications.

vbs is opening in brwser
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your VBS file is opening in a browser instead of running, it could be due to the file association settings on your system. Here’s how to fix that:

Change File Association for VBS Files
Right-click on the VBS file.
Select Open with > Choose another app.
If you see Windows Script Host or Microsoft Windows Based Script Host in the list, select it.
Make sure to check the box that says Always use this app to open .vbs files.
Click OK.
Alternative Way to Run the VBS File
If you want to run the VBS file without changing file associations, you can do it from the Command Prompt:

Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Navigate to the directory where your VBS file is located using the cd command. For example:
cmd
Copy code
cd C:\path\to\your\file
Run the script by typing:
cmd
Copy code
cscript OpenClockDialog.vbs
If Problems Persist
If you're still having issues:

Ensure that Windows Script Host is enabled on your system. You can check this in the Group Policy settings or the registry.
If you’re using a security software, it might be blocking scripts from running.

yy1.py: error: the following arguments are required: --file       files are in /raaw/*.mp4  i wan to upload all the categery is art
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It looks like you're trying to run a Python script (yy1.py) that requires certain command-line arguments to upload files, specifically MP4 files from a directory. Based on the error message, it seems you're missing the required --file argument.

Example Command
To upload all MP4 files from the /raaw/ directory with the category set to art, you can use a loop in your command line. Here’s how you can do it:

For Windows Command Prompt
Open the Command Prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your yy1.py script is located.

Run the following command:

cmd
Copy code
for %f in (C:\path\to\raaw\*.mp4) do python yy1.py --file "%f" --category art
For Linux or macOS Terminal
Open the terminal.

Navigate to the directory where your yy1.py script is located.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
for f in /raaw/*.mp4; do python yy1.py --file "$f" --category art; done
Additional Parameters
If you want to specify optional parameters like --title, --description, --keywords, or --privacyStatus, you can add them in the command:

bash
Copy code
for f in /raaw/*.mp4; do python yy1.py --file "$f" --category art --title "Your Title" --description "Your Description" --keywords "keyword1,keyword2" --privacyStatus public; done
Notes
Replace "Your Title" and "Your Description" with the appropriate text.
Make sure to adjust the file paths according to your system.
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the script and that all dependencies are installed.

pic the title as file name
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To use the file name as the title when running your yy1.py script, you can modify the command to extract the base name of each file. Here’s how to do it for both Windows and Linux/macOS.

For Windows Command Prompt
You can use the following command:

cmd
Copy code
for %f in (C:\path\to\raaw\*.mp4) do (
    set "filename=%~nf"
    python yy1.py --file "%f" --title "!filename!" --category art
)
Note: You need to enable delayed variable expansion by running this command in a batch script. Here’s how you can do it in a batch file (upload.bat):

batch
Copy code
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
for %%f in (C:\path\to\raaw\*.mp4) do (
    set "filename=%%~nf"
    python yy1.py --file "%%f" --title "!filename!" --category art
)
endlocal
For Linux or macOS Terminal
You can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
for f in /raaw/*.mp4; do
    title=$(basename "$f" .mp4)
    python yy1.py --file "$f" --title "$title" --category art
done
Explanation
%~nf (Windows): This extracts the file name without the extension.
basename "$f" .mp4 (Linux/macOS): This gets the base name of the file, removing the .mp4 extension.
Make sure to adjust the paths accordingly. Let me know if you need further assistance!
